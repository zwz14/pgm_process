---------- purpose ----------
process pgm file from my another repostery: TableKeyBoard

---------- Main ----------
read main_DEPTHimage.m and main_IRimage.m as two main function
[main_DEPTHimage.m] process depth image. Find plane in image to recognize hand (not good).
[main_IRimage.m]    process IR image. Find edge of hand and recognize fingertip.

2) how to convert depth data from hololens to real depth
   refer to https://github.com/Microsoft/HoloLensForCV/issues/63 answer of 'Huangying-Zhan'
3) about valid pixels 
   refer to https://github.com/Microsoft/HoloLensForCV/issues/56 answer of 'zwz14'
   (1) ShortThrowToFDepth takes 0.2m(200) to 1.0m(1000) as valid pixels.
   (2) the valid-pixel area is cicle instead of the whole 450Ã—488 area
4) how to recognize fingertip
