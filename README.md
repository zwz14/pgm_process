# pgm_process
---------- purpose ----------

process pgm file from my another repostery: TableKeyBoard

---------- Main ----------

read main_DEPTHimage.m and main_IRimage.m as two main function
[main_DEPTHimage.m] process depth image. Find plane in image to recognize hand (not good).
[main_IRimage.m]    process IR image. Find edge of hand and recognize fingertip.

---------- sample ----------

[sampleImage.pgm] depth image from Hololens
[r_sampleImage.pgm] IR image from Hololens, the same frame of 'sampleImage.pgm'
[short_throw_depth_camera_space_projection.bin] used for get real depth
[z_compensate.bytes] process from 'short_throw_depth_camera_space_projection.bin', depth image divided by z_compensate equal real depth

---------- other materials ----------

1) how to get raw data of depth camera

   refer to https://github.com/zwz14/TableKeyBoard/blob/master/README.md
2) how to convert depth data from hololens to real depth

   refer to https://github.com/Microsoft/HoloLensForCV/issues/63 answer of 'Huangying-Zhan'
3) about valid pixels 

   refer to https://github.com/Microsoft/HoloLensForCV/issues/56 answer of 'zwz14'
   (1) ShortThrowToFDepth takes 0.2m(200) to 1.0m(1000) as valid pixels.
   (2) the valid-pixel area is cicle instead of the whole 450Ã—488 area
4) how to recognize fingertip

   refer to article: Vision-Based Finger Action Recognition by Angle Detection and Contour Analysis
